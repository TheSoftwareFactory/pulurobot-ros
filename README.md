For launch pulu's gazebo only:

$ roslaunch pulurobot_gazebo pulurobot_world.launch


For launch pulu on gazebo and Rviz:

$ roslaunch pulurobot_description pulurobot_gazebo_rviz.launch


For launch pulu on gazebo and Rviz with the 2D mapping (gmapping):

$ roslaunch pulurobot_description pulurobot_gazebo_rviz_gmapping.launch


For launch the 3D mapping with octomap:

$ roslaunch pulurobot_description octomap.launch


For launch the 2D mapping with gmapping:

$ roslaunch pulurobot_description gmapping.launch


For launch pulu's 2D navigation:
